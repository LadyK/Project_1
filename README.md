# Project_1: Basic Agents 
15% of your grade
Due Friday March 6th by 4pm


Create an application utilizing agents with sensors (steering capabilities) and forces. Make some of these agents and forces response to the mouse and keyboard. Utilize the proper use of classes for each agent and various systems, along with arrays and array lists.

Ingredients:
- Vectors
- Forces
- Systems
- Steering Behaviors: Seek, Arrive, Flee; Pursuit, Wander, Evade; Basic Path Following, Flocking, Obstacle Avoidance
- Agents
- Interaction

This could take the form of a simple game, an animation, a safari or koi pond. When agents are given some intelligence (limited ability to sense the environment, choose an action and move), we tend to associate or interpret that movement at times as personality traits, behaviors or moods. Consider this as you build your project.

Projects must be at least 80 lines code (excluding comments and white space).
